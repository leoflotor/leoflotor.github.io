# Differential Evolution

Hi! Welcome.

I hope this entry to be kind of different to the first one I made a looong time ago.

I started using vanilla [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) recenlty, I give thanks 
to professor [Guerra](https://www.uv.mx/personal/aguerra/) for this. I learned some 
[SBCL](https://www.sbcl.org/) during his [lectures](https://www.uv.mx/personal/aguerra/docencia/),
and I became amazed of how integrated the coding experience writting `lisp` using [SLIME](https://slime.common-lisp.dev/) 
is. I come from *Julia land* where the workflow is heavily based on using the Julia REPL. 
Eventually I found myself enjoying more writting `lisp` than `julia` using their respective workflows,
but I really missed `julia`'s package manager.

Then, due to my itching curiosity, I stumbled upon other lisp-like languages. First I found
[Clojure](https://clojure.org/), then I found [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/). I first liked 
`clojure` the most because of the *build your own products vibe*, but quickly became 
confused in the docs. On the other hand, `racket` seemed very very similar to what I already 
knew. Then, as always, I lost my time reading blog posts on which one to choose or if I should 
keep up with `sbcl` instead. 

Now I was in the same hole we all get to when learning a new programming language: *what project(s) 
can I do? which tutorials can I follow?* and so on... You know how this goes. The 
neverending days of zero progress, just me and tutorial hole. Oh, and don't forget the imposter 
syndrome.

I hope `racket` perseveres and becomes a thriving language in the future just like I hope the 
same for `julia`, kudos to the communities behind both languages.
