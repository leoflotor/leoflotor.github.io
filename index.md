# About

Hey! I'm Leo (not legally named Matthias by my parents but you can call me so). I am doing a masters degree in artificial intelligence at [IIA](https://www.uv.mx/iiia/), working under the guidance of one of Quiroz-Castellanos Marcela.

I just learned about the magic of lisp, and I've been trying to do some small problems using Racket.

Feel free to contact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/leoflotor), [github](https://github.com/leoflotor) or you can send me a direct message to my `leonardoflotor` at `outlook.com` or `gmail.com`.
